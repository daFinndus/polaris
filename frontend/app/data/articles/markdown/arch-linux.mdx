Arch Linux is one of the most popular Linux distributions. Why? Because it is known for its difficulty. A lot of people fail to install it, and even more fail to use it. But if you are one of the people who succeed, you will be rewarded with a powerful and highly customizable operating system. The operating system is known for its minimalism and simplicity, which allows you to build your system from the ground up. This means that you can install only the software you need, and nothing more. This is in contrast to other distributions like Ubuntu or Fedora, which come with a lot of pre-installed software that you may not need.

But there is a light side to this. Arch Linux has a great documentation, a huge community, and a lot of resources available online. Personally to this point I was only using Windows, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and MacOS. Operating systems that are known for their ease of use and user-friendliness. After the Pewdiepie Video about Linux I wanted to try Arch out for myself.

<br />

I tried installing Hyprland and the Nvidia drivers probably around ten times, until it was working. I was following the documentation, but never exactly knew what I needed. Then I was checking some youtube tutorials, and they were nearly all working with <b>Archinstall</b>. This is a guided installer, which made installing the desktop environment and necessary drivers a lot easier. After missing the network configuration, a lot of blackscreens, a lot of trial and error, and a lot of reboots, it finally worked.

Setting up the desktop environment was a bit of a challenge, but also real fun. Seeing how the whole system changed to my needs and preferences was so satisfying. Adding a custom taskbar, I used waybar, editing it with CSS, and adding custom scripts to it was a great experience. Currently I use Hyprlock as my login and lock screen, which may be more insecure than SDDM, but I love the look of it and hope that no one tries to crack my system. So currently my taskbar shows CPU, GPU and RAM usage, all my workspaces, the volume, my ip address, the time, and more. A lot of it is completely safe made with bash scripts, which I learned to write during the process. The volume can be modified with a simple click to mute, scroll to change volume, right click to open the volume settings and the whole widget itself changes color depending on the audio status. There is literally no limit to what you can do with Hyprland and the right tools. Here is my desktop:

Because I am dual booting with Windows, I had to install the correct bootloader, I used GRUB. Because of certain video games I still need Microsoft's operating system, as well as Secure Boot. This was a tough challenge, I nearly bricked my system, had to install a different bootloader, had multiple blackscreens, but it worked. Now I have Secure Boot enabled, using systemd-boot instead of GRUB, and can boot into both operating systems without any issues.

<br />

<b>TL;DR</b>: Arch Linux is such a powerful and highly customizable operating system. It runs on nearly every system, because of its
low resource usage, and it is a great way to express yourself. Installing and maintaining it is a challenge, but also a lot of fun
and very manageable. For Gamers: The most triple A games are supported, and you can use Proton to play most of the other games. If
you are looking for a challenge, and want to learn more about Linux, I highly recommend trying Arch Linux out for yourself. It is a
great way to learn more about the operating system, and it is a lot of fun to use.
